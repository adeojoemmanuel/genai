# GENAI IMPLEMENTATION 

# requirement 
    - install nodejs on your computer 
    - install python 


## getting started

- Set up a Python enviornment and install all required libraries by navigating to the backend directory and performing the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the backend directory

- Run the backend by running "python app.py"

- Then once it's running, open up a separate terminal and head over to the client directory

- Run "npm i" to install all required node modules

- Run the frontend using "npm run dev" and make sure you go to "localhost:3000/chatbot" or "localhost:3000/chatbot"



# HOW DO YOU UPDATE THE DATASET 
 - go into the backend directory and then navigate to the data directory
 - you would see a csv file, you can simple replace it with yours, and rename yours to the exact same name of the env



 ## stack used 
 - nextjs for the client side  application
 - python3 for the backend application
